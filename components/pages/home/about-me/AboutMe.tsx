              <p>
                Based in Dallas, Texas, I&apos;m a full-stack engineer and technical leader specializing in crypto, healthcare, and edtech platforms. My journey began at the intersection of content strategy and emerging tech, but quickly evolved as I led engineering teams and launched high-impact products for fast-growth startups and complex organizations.
              </p>
              <p>
                I&apos;ve architected and scaled platforms like BB Terminal (crypto analytics suite), Telos Health (modular healthcare platform), and BB Academy (education CMS), driving projects from initial concept to production deployment. I&apos;m passionate about building robust systems end-to-end, leading teams, and applying the latest in cloud, security, and modern frameworks to deliver user-driven experiences.
              </p>
              <p>
                I hold a Bachelor&apos;s in ICT with a concentration in cybersecurity, and I consistently bring technical depth, product vision, and a bias for action to every projectâ€”always pushing for best practices, strong security, and future-ready solutions.
